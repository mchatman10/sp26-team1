## About Me
I am currently a Sophomore at UNCG and I am aspiring to be a game developer with my path through software engineering. My secondary dream would be becoming a software developer and try to develop applications that would be beneficial to gamers. In my past time I enjoy playing video games, listening to music, and drinking water.

## My CSC340 Goals
My goal with CSC340 is to dip my toes into the world of coding and understand the ins and outs of the process of developing software to further realize my dream of game development.
