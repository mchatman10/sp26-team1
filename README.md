## Description 
Smash Bros. Fiverr is an app where people can share their talents in games in the Super Smash Brothers game series and assist customers in improving at the game. Suppliers would be hire-able coaches that set their own pay rates for players (customers) to pay and hire by the hour. They post themselves as a coach for hire with certain demographics checked like "Newer Players" or "Super Smash Bros. Ultimate" and can write a description of their experience, results, etc. to better sell themselves. Customers can write reviews on coaches to promise the best results for a certain demographic of smash player (newer players, experienced players, etc.) that can be filtered by on the site. Coaches can also filter what demographic of players they'd be willing to coach. The app is made simply to better facilitate coaching for all demographics of Super Smash Bros. and increase the Smash Bros. player demographic.
